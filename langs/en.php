		With the recent spread of the Korean Wave, international interest in Korea’s economic development and democracy continues to grow. Academic and global interest in contemporary Korea is at an all-time high, not only in popular culture such as K-Pop and K-dramas, but also in Korea’s political and economic growth and its democratization process.<br><br>
		
		However, Korean Studies to date has mainly focused on language and history, with historical research often limited to the medieval or Joseon periods. Such a trend has not sufficiently reflected the domestic and international demand surrounding contemporary Korea. It is therefore necessary to conduct research centered on contemporary Korea, expanding beyond the confines of language and history to encompass diverse fields such as politics, economy, society, and the cultural industries.<br><br>
		
		In response, the Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Contemporary Korea aims to establish itself as a global hub for contemporary Korean studies by pursuing comprehensive research across various domains. Currently, the Institute comprises ten research teams, namely the Democracy and Democratization Team, K-Future Team, Political Economy Team, K-New Technology Team, K-Narrative Team, Values and Identity Team, Modernity and Development History Team, Contemporary Korean Music Team, Global Korean Wave Studies Team, and the Statehood and Civil Society Team. Each team is organized not only to examine contemporary Korea from multiple perspectives but also to provide comprehensive insights into the subject.<br><br>
		
		While each research team addresses its own independent themes, they collaborate closely based on an interdisciplinary approach. For instance, the K-Narrative Team and the K-Future Team actively respond to diverse global interests and research demands on Korea through interdisciplinary research agendas. To facilitate such integrative research, the teams consist of scholars from a wide range of academic disciplines, enabling genuine convergence research.<br><br>
		
		Moreover, whereas existing research has often emphasized the uniqueness of Korea, the Institute seeks to shed light on Korea’s universal significance within the broader context of human history. Korea, which began as a colony and a latecomer to development, achieved rapid modernization and economic growth in a short time and transitioned politically into a stable democracy. Korea’s development experience transcends being a mere individual case; it can expand as a universal model and alternative for human progress. In particular, research is needed on its potential for comparison and application in developing countries.<br><br>
		
		The Institute aims to lead both domestic and international research on contemporary Korea based on such studies. In particular, it is working to establish the “SNU Contact Point” to ensure that Seoul National University serves as the practical center and global hub for Korean Studies through connections with universities both in Korea and abroad.<br><br>
		
		In addition, the Institute aspires to create a virtuous cycle between research and education. To sustain Korean Studies, it is essential not only to produce new research that meets contemporary demands but also to continuously nurture the next generation of scholars who will carry this field forward. Training future scholars is crucial, as they will become a significant driving force and resource for research on contemporary Korea and will play a key role in maintaining and expanding global interest in the country. Therefore, the Institute aims to achieve a new leap forward in contemporary Korean studies by building a global network and fostering close cooperation both domestically and internationally, with “education based on research” as its guiding principle.

	'greeting.desc' => '
		The Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Contemporary Korea at Seoul National University was established with the aim of becoming a global hub for comprehensive research and education on contemporary Korea.<br><br>

		In recent years, global interest in Korea has been rapidly increasing, leading to a growing academic demand for research and education related to contemporary Korea. However, at present, there remains a lack of systematic efforts to effectively respond to this rising demand.<br><br>

		In response to this situation, our Institute has formed ten specialized research teams covering diverse fields, including politics, economy, society, culture, and technology in Korea. Each team not only conducts research within their respective academic disciplines but also seeks to provide more comprehensive insights through interdisciplinary approaches.<br><br>

		Building on these research achievements, we strive to strengthen networks among Korean Studies scholars both domestically and internationally and to create new opportunities for global academic exchange. Furthermore, we aim to establish a virtuous cycle between research and education by nurturing the next generation of scholars.<br><br>

		With this mission in mind, we operate this website to archive the research activities carried out by each team, as well as scholarly initiatives conducted at the Institute level, and to widely share this information with audiences in Korea and around the world.<br><br>

		We hope that your journey with the Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Contemporary Korea will be a meaningful one that expands the horizons of Korean Studies.<br><br>

		Thank you.
